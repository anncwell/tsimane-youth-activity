[The Tsimane Health and Life History Project](https://tsimane.anth.ucsb.edu/) (THLHP) is a joint health and anthropology project aimed at understanding the impacts of ecology and evolution on the shaping of the human life course. The THLHP is conducted in partnership with the Tsimane and Moseten, indigenous forager-farming groups living in central lowland Bolivia in the Beni Department. It focuses on health, growth and development, aging, economics and biodemography of small-scale populations of hunter-gatherers and horticulturalists. The team combines biomedical and anthropological research with local Bolivian medical services. To perform these efforts requires a multidisciplinary, international team supported by diverse stakeholders. The THLHPâ€™s highest priority is the safeguarding of human subjects and minimization of risk to study participants. Over and above individual safety, the THLHP adheres to the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance. These Principles assure the Tsimane and Moseten 1) have sovereignty over how data are shared, 2) are the primary gatekeepers determining ethical use, 3) are actively engaged in the data generation and 4) derive benefit from data generated and shared use whenever possible. Pragmatically, the data are generated under the authority of the Tsimane (Gran Consejo Tsimane)/Moseten governments for use for specified research activities. Further guidance with respect to data access is often provided by research sponsors. The THLHP is committed to the FAIR Principles to facilitate data use with third parties.

The THLHP is also committed to the FAIR Principles to facilitate data use. Requests for individual-level data should take the form of an application that minimally details the exact uses of the data and the research questions to be addressed, procedures that will be employed for data security and individual privacy, potential benefits to the study communities, and procedures for assessing and minimizing stigmatizing interpretations of the research results (see the following webpage for links to the data sharing policy and data request forms: [https://tsimane.anth.ucsb.edu/data.html](https://tsimane.anth.ucsb.edu/data.html). Requests for individual-level data will require institutional IRB approval (even if exempt) and will be reviewed by an Advisory Council composed of tribal leaders, tribal community members, Bolivian scientists, and the THLHP leadership. The study authors and the Tsimane leadership are committed to open science.
